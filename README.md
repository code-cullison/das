# What is [DAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_acoustic_sensing)?

## Jupyter Notebooks for preprocessing DAS data in parallel using mpi4py, dask, and multiprocessing package
## Functions for reading data from GC storage

### For the the mpi4py notebook, OS libraries for MPI must be installed.  Also ipyparallel needs to be installed and an MPI cluster profile needs to be created for Jupyter.
